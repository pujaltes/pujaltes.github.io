I"^<p>Interactive plot to visualize spike rate function with different parameters of gaussian smoothing on real data.</p>

<p>The spike trains were recorded from Rhesus macaque monkeys while they performed a cognitively demanding task. The neurons with ‘DET’ 
were recorded during a simple detection task where ‘A’ is the amplitude of the stimulus. All other neurons are from a pattern discrimination task where there are two possible stimuli given over two stimulus periods.</p>

<p>I currently host my apps for free on Huroku so they may take some time to initially load.</p>
