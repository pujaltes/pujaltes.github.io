I"<p>Interactively test different binning parameters when estimating the firing rate of a neuron. I have also given the user the option to test out various z-transforms which may be useful when analyzing and comparing different neurons.</p>

<p>The spike trains were recorded from Rhesus macaque monkeys while they performed a cognitively demanding task. The neurons with â€˜DETâ€™ 
were recorded during a simple detection task where â€˜Aâ€™ is the amplitude of the stimulus. All other neurons are from a pattern discrimination task where there are two possible stimuli given over two stimulus periods.</p>

<p>I currently host my apps on Huroku for free so they may take some time to initially load.</p>
