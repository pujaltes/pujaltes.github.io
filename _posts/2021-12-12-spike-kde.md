Interactive plot to visualize how we obtain a spike rate function with gaussian smoothing (essentially the same thing as kde). I currently host my apps for free on Huroku so they may take some time to initially load. Please be patient.

## Spike Rate Function
A real world example of spike rate functions can be found in my [Interactive Spike Rate Function](https://pujaltes.github.io/blog/spike-smoothing) post.
For more information, please refer to Sidney R Lehky's [Decoding Poisson Spike Trains by Gaussian Filtering](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40758726_Decoding_Poisson_Spike_Trains_by_Gaussian_Filtering) article.
